pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Framework

1. Basic Usage:
```bash
python -m hybrid_linearization.main
```

2. The script will:
   - Load the MNIST dataset
   - Extract features using the ImageFeatureExtractor
   - Apply Taylor series linearization
   - Train an optimized SVM model
   - Generate visualizations and benchmark results
   - Save results to the output directory

## Detailed Component Explanation

### 1. Feature Extraction

#### Image Features (`ImageFeatureExtractor`)
- Extracts multiple types of features:
  - HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
  - SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
  - Geometric invariants (curvature, topological features)
- Preprocesses images for consistent feature extraction
- Combines features into a unified representation

#### Speech Features (`SpeechFeatureExtractor`)
- Extracts audio features:
  - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
  - Spectrograms
  - Temporal features (pitch, onset strength)
  - Phoneme transitions
- Handles audio preprocessing and normalization

### 2. Linearization Framework

#### Taylor Series Linearization (`TaylorLinearization`)
- Implements adaptive Taylor series expansion
- Key features:
  - Automatic order selection
  - Numerical stability handling
  - Feature space transformation
- Process:
  1. Compute derivatives up to specified order
  2. Apply Taylor series expansion
  3. Optimize expansion order
  4. Transform feature space

#### Quality Metrics (`LinearizationQualityMetrics`)
- Measures linearization effectiveness:
  - Separability metrics (silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin)
  - Linearity metrics (centroid alignment, feature independence)
  - Stability metrics (bootstrap stability, feature importance)
- Provides comprehensive evaluation of feature space quality

#### Visualization (`LinearizationVisualizer`)
- Creates visual representations:
  - Feature space plots
  - Linearization progress
  - Quality metrics visualization
  - Feature importance plots
  - Correlation matrices

### 3. Model Implementation

#### SVM Optimization (`SVMOptimizer`)
- Implements dynamic kernel selection
- Features:
  - Automatic kernel type selection
  - Hyperparameter optimization
  - Feature importance computation
- Process:
  1. Select optimal kernel based on data characteristics
  2. Optimize hyperparameters using grid search
  3. Train final model
  4. Evaluate performance

#### Cross-modal Enhancement (`CrossModalEnhancer`)
- Implements feature mapping between modalities
- Features:
  - Bidirectional mapping (image ↔ speech)
  - Feature enhancement through domain transformation
  - Quality evaluation of mappings
- Process:
  1. Prepare features for mapping
  2. Train mapping networks
  3. Apply cross-modal transformations
  4. Evaluate mapping quality

### 4. Benchmarking Framework

#### Model Benchmark (`ModelBenchmark`)
- Compares different model approaches:
  - Linearization-based model
  - CNN model
  - Transformer model
- Measures:
  - Training time
  - Inference time
  - Memory usage
  - Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1, accuracy)
- Generates comprehensive reports and visualizations

## Example Usage

```python
from hybrid_linearization import (
    ImageFeatureExtractor,
    TaylorLinearization,
    SVMOptimizer,
    CrossModalEnhancer,
    ModelBenchmark
)

# Initialize components
image_extractor = ImageFeatureExtractor()
taylor = TaylorLinearization()
svm_optimizer = SVMOptimizer()
cross_modal = CrossModalEnhancer()
benchmark = ModelBenchmark()

# Extract features
image_features = image_extractor.extract_all_features(images)

# Linearize feature space
linearization_results = taylor.linearize_feature_space(
    image_features,
    labels
)

# Train SVM model
svm_optimizer.train(
    linearization_results['linearized_features'],
    labels
)

# Evaluate performance
metrics = svm_optimizer.evaluate(
    test_features,
    test_labels
)

# Run benchmarks
benchmark_results = benchmark.benchmark_linearization(
    svm_optimizer,
    train_features,
    train_labels,
    test_features,
    test_labels
)
```
